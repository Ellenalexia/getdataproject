## Variables
Tidy data set includes:
* Subject ID
* Activity
* Means of standard deviations and means from original measurements

## Summary

The original data are human movement measurements from a smartphone taken in 2012.

Specifically:
* 30 volunteers ages 19-48 years
* 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
* Smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) worn on the waist 

Using phone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, scientists captured 
* 3-axial linear acceleration and 
* 3-axial angular velocity 
* at a constant rate of 50Hz
These measurements are provided in a "561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables"
